Computer Science is getting more and more important for different fields of our lives. One important part of our life is medicine. Whenever we go to a doctor, visit a hospital or get pharmaceuticals from a pharmacy, information about our health condition is collected. Until now, this data remains mostly unused. \\
This thesis describes how we can benefit from analyzing this data and improve our medical condition. By learning from past data, we can try to predict future diseases and treat illnesses before they even occur. In addition, this method should be easily usable by medics without any technical background and embedded in i2b2.
