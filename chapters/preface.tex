\section*{Preface}

The relevance of computer science is increasing for every section of our lives. Today, various information about our medical condition is collected whenever one visits a doctor or gets treated in a hospital. This data remains rather unused but analyzing it can ....
i2b2 is a software which allows physicians to easily and rapidly analyze this data without having any technical background. One of the main goals of our project was increasing performance for larger datasets by supporting the distributed database system HPCC. Furthermore, the data should be analyzed in detail by creating an interface for using R embedded in i2b2.
The work on our project is spread over six bachelor theses. Marc Philipp-Bismar explains how querying the data for i2b2 can be speeded up using either a relational or a distributed database system in “Database Optimization for Big Medical Data and i2b2”. Sven Lehmann expounds how to adapt i2b2’s standard SQL-interface for HPCC’s own ECL query language in “A Federated database system with support for HPCC by using SQL”. In “Optimization and Extension of the HPCC JDBC Driver” Peter Schwarz describes how to design a JDBC-Driver efficiently for big data analytics.
